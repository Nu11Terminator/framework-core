# Template
Templates are defined in HTML files and are made available by the *template!* plugin.


## Methods

**render**  
Use the *render* method to generate an HTML string from the template and optional data.

**renderToView**  
Use the *renderToView* method to define the root element in a *View*, rather than having the *View* generate the root element for you.
