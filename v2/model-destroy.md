title: Model - destroy
---

# destroy
Use the *destroy* method to delete the model from the server using the HTTP method DELETE.
 

## Syntax
`destroy(options)`


## Parameters

**options**  
The options parameter is an object that can contain any or all of the following properties.

- **success**  
  `function(model, response, options)`  
  A callback function that is called if the request succeeds.

- **error**  
  `function(model, response, options, error)`  
  A callback function that is called if the request fails. This is a required parameter.

- **abortsLogLevel**  
  A logging level designation used when the request generated by this call is aborted.


## Additional AJAX Options
You can provide additional properties to the options object. The framework then provides those values to the jQuery settings object when making the ajax call.


## Return value
If the model contains an *id* property, *destroy* returns a jqXHR. If the model does not contain an *id* property, destroy returns false.


## Errors thrown
If you do not provide an error callback, the call to *destroy* throws an error.
