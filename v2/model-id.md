# id
Use the *id* property to uniquely identify the modelsâ€™ resource.

All models have unique IDs that can be integers or arbitrary strings.

Set the *id* in an attributes hash to copy it to the *id* property of a model. Use the model *id* to retrieve models from a collection. By default, ids are used to generate model URLs.
